# WebViewer - React sample

[WebViewer](https://www.pdftron.com/webviewer) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that's part of the [PDFTron PDF SDK](https://www.pdftron.com). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

This repo is specifically designed for any users interested in integrating WebViewer into React project. This project was generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more information.

## Initial setup

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/PDFTron/webviewer-react-sample.git
cd webviewer-react-sample
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

To test the build directory locally you can use [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) or [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). In case of serve, by default it strips the .html extension stripped from paths. We added serve.json configuration to disable cleanUrls option.
